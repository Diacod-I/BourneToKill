# BourneToKill
This is a side-project derived from my hobby and interest in reading criminal cases and psychology.<br>A genetic/bioinformatics project on analysis of gene data for genes like MAOA, CHD13 etc. that are known to cause aggressive and antisocial behavior in prominent criminals. <br>
This project utilizes data from the [ChemBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) database and queries are taken from its resources.
