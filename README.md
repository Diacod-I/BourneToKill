# BourneToKill
This is a side-project derived from my hobby and interest in reading criminal cases and psychology.<br><br>A genetics/bioinformatics project on analysis of data on genes like MAOA, CHD13 etc. that are known to cause aggressive and antisocial behavior in prominent criminals and the discovery of inhibitory drugs that can have pharmaceutical importance. <br><br>
This project utilizes data from the [ChemBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) database and queries are taken from its resources.
